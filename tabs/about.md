# About this site
I created this site to publish content about practical examples using python applied to real-life analytical problems. This is specially created for people transitioning from other analytics tools like Stata, SAS, R or Excel, among others.

# About me
I have master degree in Information Technology with specializationin Data Analytics and Business Intelligence. I coursed my studies in the US and Australia at Carnegie Mellon University (CMU). Currently, I am a Data Scientist at the Department of the Premier and Cabinet of South Australia. I am also a teaching assistance for courses in the US and Australia at CMU like Data Focused Python, Programming R, Unstrutured Data Analytics, Internet of Things, etc. I also love traveling and learning new things like languages or playing new instruments. Additionally, I am giving back to the community as a volunteer for the State Emergency Service of South Australia. I am always happy to discuss about any topic in general, but specially about Data Science and it's usage in making our society better.
