## About this site
This site was created to publish content about python and practical examples applied to real-life analytics problems. This is especially thought for people transitioning from other analytics tools like Stata, SAS, R or Excel, among others. I will be posting practical examples on how to solve issues as well as common and avanced knowledge in Python usage. We have identified that a transtion process is taking place in governmental organization like the one I work in, and we want to contribute in that transition. However, these resources are open to the public in general for obtaining practical knowledge in how to deal with real-life analytics problems. 

## About me
I have a master's degree in Information Technology with a specialization in Data Analytics and Business Intelligence. I coursed my studies in the US and Australia at Carnegie Mellon University (CMU). Currently, I am a Data Scientist at the Department of the Premier and Cabinet of South Australia. I am also a teaching assistant for courses in the US and Australia at CMU like Data Focused Python, Programming R, Unstructured Data Analytics, Internet of Things, among others. Additionally, I am giving back to the community as a volunteer for the State Emergency Service of South Australia. I am always happy to discuss any topic in general, but especially about Data Science and its usage in making our society better.
