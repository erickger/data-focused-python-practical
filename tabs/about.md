## About this site
I created this site to publish content about python and practical examples applied to real-life analytical problems. This is especially thought for people transitioning from other analytics tools like Stata, SAS, R or Excel, among others.

## About me
I have a master's degree in Information Technology with a specialization in Data Analytics and Business Intelligence. I coursed my studies in the US and Australia at Carnegie Mellon University (CMU). Currently, I am a Data Scientist at the Department of the Premier and Cabinet of South Australia. I am also a teaching assistant for courses in the US and Australia at CMU like Data Focused Python, Programming R, Unstructured Data Analytics, Internet of Things, etc. I also love traveling and learning new things like languages or playing new instruments. Additionally, I am giving back to the community as a volunteer for the State Emergency Service of South Australia. I am always happy to discuss any topic in general, but especially about Data Science and its usage in making our society better. You can reach out to my personal email egrodriguezal@gmail.com, and my LinkedIn profile is on the website.
