Python is an object-oriented programming language that was created in the late 1980s in the Netherlands by Guido van Rossum. Yes! Python is not as young as you might have thought. Guido named this programming language "Python" inspired by the BBC comedy series "Monty Python". In 2003 Python started becoming popular, especially due to its readability, simplicity, and accessibility. Nowadays Python has become extensively used not only for analysis but for development. Python ranks second according to GitHub<sup>1</sup>. Being JavaScript first one in this ranking. Thus, we should say that python is the most popular programming language for analytics.

Let's go to what's important to us. **Why to use python?**

- Python is **simple**. Python can be easily learned in comparison to other programming languages. Python is very intuitive and very easy to read.
- A lot of **packages**. Simplicity also means you don't need to write code for complex models. Python has a myriad of packages for data manipulation and analysis (e.g. Pandas, NumPy, StatsModels, etc.).
- Plenty of **support**. Since Python is very popular, it has a lot of support. You can find all types of resources on the python website [(python documentation website)](https://docs.python.org/3/). Additionally, there are many pages like StackOverflow where you can find answers to your questions straight away. If you have a problem and you are stuck then most likely somebody elseÂ has already solved it.- You have access to a rich **visualization** library. Python has many libraries that you can use to visualize data. That means you can go from very simple charts to very complex multidimensional visualizations.
- Python is **free**. Yes! Python is an open-source platform and you can use it for free.
- Not only analytics but **software development**. Python is so powerful that you cannot only use it for analytics but for software development. For instance, you could create websites with Flask, which is a web framework in Python.
